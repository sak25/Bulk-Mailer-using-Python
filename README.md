# Bulk Mailer using Python
 This project was aimed at developing a bulk mailing software, for the use in our PS station. Sending bulk mails via gmail or any other web with personalised messages is a very tedious task and consumes a lot of time.The software will be used to send personalised emails to employees of the organisation which could be used for  sending memos,  providing customers the services like RPP (Rajasthan Payment Platform) to send information, promotional emails and also to the visitors of their website etc. The project is coded in python with use of MS Excel and text file. The mass mailer contains various other features like error log, standard message with specifications in a text file and a configuration file as well. This code developed for mass mailer reads the email ids with CC, BCC To fields of the recipients and other columns such as Name,Address of the receiver  from an excel or a comma separated file and send to them a standard message with customization for each receiver
